#input file template for a recirculating pebbles in a core, assuming
#you already have a coordinate map (in dumpfile form) of a settled pebble
#bed.

#general steps:  include variable block, put in all the math
#(this should be the same as the other main file)
#put in all the communication/neighbor/log/etc options
#dump file generation
#include all your region files
#build the whole core region
#read the settled pebble dump file
#to recirc: define an extra region at the bottom of the outtake cylinder
#that is the full radius, but is only ~1 pebble high.
#move all pebbles from that region to the intake zone
#^for this, you will EITHER move them up to the intake, "back through" the core
#or you will use a periodic boundary, and shift the pebbles down far enough to
#cross it, which SHOULD make them wrap around and appear on the other side.
#the math for moving them back through the core is potentially more complicated,
#but you aren't forced to have your intake and outtakes be the same
#or perfectly aligned.
#run long enough for the pebbles to fall
#you should (???) be able (???) to roughly calculate how long (aka, how many
#time steps) it should take for a pebble falling under the influence of gravity
#to fall [a distance at least 1 pebble diameter (the height of the recirc-dsicharge zone)]
# and then use that to auto-calculate timing somehow.
#do it again
#for a REALLY long time



updated notes:

alright.  displace atoms is good, creating a group to recirc SHOULD be good,
but some commands don't actually work with dynamic groups (I did not see a list
of commands that do, and the doc page for displace_atoms doesn't say either way)


You're gonna want to loop your commands.  There are two ways to do this - one,
using the lammps python interface, and one using the jump command in LAMMPS to
create a loop that jumps back into itself from a certain point.  You're gonna
want to reference the docs and make a few small test inputs with print statements
or something to make sure you're looping the right number of times.
